1920x1440 to 2560x1440 stretch of a videoclip using OpenCV.
  
The stretch is only in horizontal direction and is based on projecting the image on a cylinder secton of plus minus 73 degrees.  
The calculation is in the XL sheet and was exported to a csv file to get rid of the formulas and only get the values.  
The columns that are not used were deleted and was inserted directly in the cpp file.  
  
Conclusion of the first test is that the stretch is too high in the edges but the result is anyway good for a first try.
